Episode 2: How Memory Works

Hey guys, what's up? Ava here and Aasha we can't wait can I have a sit sorry? Can I have a sit-up of your coffee?
I just got a really weird craving sorry for interrupting you. Yeah, it's right here. Wait
It was just here. Sorry. It got to be somewhere around wait
Didn't you just literally set it down dude? Yeah, I swear college has turned my brain into mush
How am I supposed to cram for exams if I can't even remember where I left my coffee?
Honestly valid point speaking of mushy college rinsed that's exactly what we're diving into today
Memory like why is it so easy to remember your middle school locker combination and
Actually wasn't that easy for me, but we'll keep that between us
But impossible to recall what you just studied five minutes ago
Seriously, I remember all the lyrics to every codec black song
But ask me what my professor said ten minutes ago and sometimes it's just static noise
Dude that always happens to me. I listen to a song like five times from like
2010 and I'll know every lyric, but then like I cannot ever remember or retain the information my professor says
Anyways, let's unpack this our brains handle memory through a three-step process encoding
consolidation and retrieval let's lock that in
Sounds like my study method skim panic and forget
Exactly, that's my favorite, but let's actually break it down
Encoding is when your rain first captures an event different parts of your cortex gather all this information
And your hippocampus ties it together think of the tip of campus like a super organized group project leader like me
Hmm
Funny one, Ava shout out to the hippocampus though tying in all the work and doing everything to help bring it together
Right then there's consolidation. This is when your brain solidifies memories
It takes repetition like rereading notes asher's really bad at that
Or telling your friend that embarrassing story again and again like when you're really embarrassing like really need to repeat a story to emotionally process it
Right or replaying that cringey conversation that Ava just had
I cannot forget that
Because you're ming the tags emotional moments making them stick around
So cring is apparently forever
Awesome, so why can't my brain consolidate where I just put down my coffee
Well, that's probably just because you're forgetful, but actually that's because consolidation can take years
Literally at first recalling a memory requires your hippocampus
Over time those memories spread out across your brain's cortex becoming independent from the hippocampus
So it's like graduating from training wheels
Exactly, but here's the kicker every time you treat memory you actually change it. It's called reconsolidation
Crazy so every story you retell gets slightly modified so basically every time you tell a story like
You're making a new story by just retelling it great
So my legendary spring break story that I told everyone is basically fiction now
Pretty much and forgetfulness isn't just your brain being lazy
It's active your brain can delete memories or fail to retrieve them when they're overshadowed by newer info
Like studying chem right after bio the old stuff gets scrambled
Right like when I mix up details from different Netflix shows because I'm watching all three series at once
Um, not relatable just you, but sure that's proactive interference, I think
Old messing, old stuff messing with the new stuff or
retroactive interference new stuff overwriting the old
Both make studying at 2 a.m. A nightmare
Which we do a lot
What about the reading we had in class like patient patient HM though his memory issues were crazy, right?
Yeah, wait thinking about that. That's a really good shout-out
patient HM had his medical
Medial temporal lobes including his uphippocampus removed to stops of your epilepsy after surgery he had
And
Enter grade I'm sorry guys little slip up there
Meaning he couldn't form new long-term declarative memories though his old memories and short-term memory were fine
Kind of interesting wait, but could he still learn new scales?
Yep, that's procedural memory which involves motor skills and doesn't depend on the hippocampus
He got better at tasks like mirror drawing without ever remember practicing it
Wow, so different types of memory involve different parts of the brain
Yep, declarative memories which I guess we can say are just facts and personal experiences
Reliant the hippocampus in cortical areas
While procedural memory
priming and habituation rely on non-declative memory systems involving structures like the basal ganglia and
various cortical areas
So next time that I'm freaking out because I forgot my coffee or I forgot everything on the exam
Just remember your brain's doing its best juggling a million bits of info. It's not just you. It's neuroscience
Okay, but for real has anyone seen my cup of coffee?
Stay caffeinated stay curious and remember to give your hippocampus a break sometimes
Thanks.
You're going to lose it.
