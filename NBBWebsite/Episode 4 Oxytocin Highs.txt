Episode 4: Oxytocin Highs

Welcome back. This is episode four, "Oxytocin Highs."

Ava:

Got it because never mind guys couldn't think of anything so we're just gonna get right into it.

Asher:

It's a Wednesday on the Emory Quad.

I'm walking past the Dooley statue on the way to the lab, totally stressed out about this organic chemistry exam, and then I see it.

A bunch of students crowded around this tiny sleeping puppy.

Without even thinking, I walk right over.

Ava:

When was this?

Asher:

I wanted to see a puppy.

You should have texted me, but I heard about this.

Suddenly half the quad was crouched around this dog.

Everyone was smiling and everyone was posting on their private stories.

It was as if finals were canceled.

And then it hit me: Why do we instantly feel better just from petting a cute dog?

It's not just that they're cute.

There's real brain chemistry happening.

Say hello to oxytocin, also known as the love hormone.

Ava:

No biggie.

It's a nonapeptide hormone made in your hypothalamus and released by your posterior pituitary.

Asher:

It's triggered by things like touch, eye contact, warm temperatures, and apparently for you, puppies.

Just kidding, for me too.

I think when it's released, it binds to oxytocin receptors all over the brain.

The amygdala, the hippocampus, the nucleus accumbens, all spots tied to emotion, memory, and reward.

That's why petting a puppy doesn't just feel good and cute.

It literally calms down your amygdala so you feel less scared or stressed.

Like that's why in my high school they would always bring puppies for like mental awareness month to calm down people.

And it lights up your reward system, telling your brain, "This is safe, stay here."

Unless I guess you have a diabolical fear of dogs like my mother.

Ava:

Wow.

Couldn't imagine being around her.

Asher:

Oxytocin even dials down cortisol, the stress hormone.

So after a rough test, seeing a puppy can literally help rebalance your stress response.

And I guess we could say it's context-dependent.

If the experience is positive, like a cute dog and a sunny quad, like what you were lucky enough to experience and didn't tell me, oxytocin will strengthen the memory.

Your hippocampus stores it as "This place equals safe, equals good vibes, equals, Asher needs to tell even X-M there's puppy on the water."

That's partly why therapy animals work so well.

It's not just the distraction.

They're triggering oxytocin release and physically calming down people's stress systems.

I think there's even research showing that people who get oxytocin boosts after stress, either through social support or even intranasal oxytocin, have lower cortisol levels and feel calmer.

Ava:

Wait, I want some of that.

Lower cortisol levels will help depuff my face.

Asher:

Wow.

Great.

So next time you're freaking out about Orgo Lab or midterm, maybe don't just hit the books harder.

Go find someone you love, look at someone pretty, or go find a cute dog.

Ordysol helps Oxytocin helps keep you relaxed.

Someone clearly needs to see a puppy because you just make stuff towards Oxytocin.

Ava:

Ordysol.

Asher:

Anyways, you've just been brain-splained.
