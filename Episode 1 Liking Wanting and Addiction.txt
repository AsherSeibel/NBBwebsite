Episode 1: Liking, Wanting, and Addiction

Ava:
Hey guys, what's up? Ava here.
Asher, are you gonna introduce yourself?

Asher:
Sure, sorry guys, I opened TikTok again.

Ava:
Didn't you just close it out?

Asher:
I swear, sometimes I close it, tell myself I'm bored and done with it, and then I find myself opening it right back up again. It's like a binge-watching craving — I can't help it.

Ava:
Honestly, that happens to me all the time with everything. That makes me wonder: how often do we say, "I don't even like this anymore," and then still do it?

Asher:
Right? Like I'm sick of TikTok half the time laying in bed, but there I am, scrolling at 2 a.m. on autopilot.

Ava:
Same. And it's not just TikTok. I'll be eating a bag of chips, put it down, and then two minutes later, I'm back eating that same bag I said I didn’t want. Or craving caffeine. Or swiping on dating apps.
Today, we're diving into why these things happen — the difference between liking something and wanting it — and how our brain's dopamine system keeps pulling the strings whether we realize it or not.

Asher:
So how do we even tell if we like something?

Ava:
Liking is about pleasure. It's handled by the brain’s endocannabinoid and opioid systems. It’s the genuine "mmm this is good" feeling — excitement and joy.

Asher:
Wanting, though, that’s a whole different beast. It’s your motivation to pursue something, running through the brain’s mesolimbic dopamine system, especially the VTA (ventral tegmental area) and the nucleus accumbens (the "nac").

Ava:
So basically, liking means enjoying it. Wanting means chasing it, whether or not you like it anymore.

Asher:
And this shows up everywhere. You’re tired of Red Bull but still crack one open during finals. You’re over Hinge but still swiping at midnight. You’re done with TikTok but open it again without thinking.

Ava:
And it’s not even your fault — it's just brain wiring.

Asher:
Let’s break it down. Imagine your VTA is like a post office.

Ava:
And your nucleus accumbens is the inbox. The VTA writes letters — dopamine signals — about exciting or rewarding things.

Asher:
Like that "liking" feeling when you eat dessert or get an Instagram like. The VTA sends a dopamine message: "Hey, that was awesome, go get more!"

Ava:
Over time, even hearing a ding or seeing a notification can trigger it — even before the reward. That’s classical conditioning.

Asher:
But if you expect something awesome and it doesn’t happen? That’s reward prediction error: no dopamine signal, empty inbox, big letdown.

Ava:
When it comes to addiction or bad habits, the post office goes haywire: sends too many dopamine signals, suddenly stops (withdrawal), or the inbox gets so full it stops caring (tolerance).

Asher:
Relapse? That’s when after months of no mail, the VTA floods the inbox and — boom — you're overwhelmed again.

Ava:
At first, dopamine fires when you get the reward (like a funny TikTok — unconditioned stimulus).

Asher:
Later, dopamine fires just from the logo (conditioned stimulus), before you even know if the video’s good.

Ava:
If the reward doesn’t come, you get that dopamine dip — inbox sadness — classic reward prediction error.

Asher:
Partial reinforcement keeps it addictive: sometimes TikToks are hilarious; sometimes boring. But that "maybe next time" keeps you coming back. It’s like gambling.

Ava:
That’s incentive salience theory: wanting something even if you don’t like it anymore.

Asher:
Over time, your mesolimbic dopamine system gets sensitized: wanting skyrockets, but liking doesn’t.

Ava:
In substance abuse, your baseline dopamine shifts. Your brain struggles to keep up with motivational "spam" — exhausting.

Asher:
So next time you’re doom-scrolling at 2 a.m., chugging a third coffee at noon, or refreshing your email for no reason — remember: it’s not just you. It’s your brain’s post office working overtime.

Ava:
Again — VTA writing motivational letters, nucleus accumbens reading every one.

Asher:
Whether it’s love, lattes, or likes — we’re just trying to sort signal from spam.

Ava:
Stay curious. And maybe… don't check the inbox every five minutes.

Asher:
Thanks for tuning in! Bye, guys.
